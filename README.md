## User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data


AS a fullstack-developer
I WANT an PORTFOLIO to show off my previous projects
SO THAT it is easy for potential employers can view my work and contact me easily.
